# Changelog

All notable changes to TrustLoop will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Customer replies no longer spawn phantom conversations.** When v0.1.1.0 introduced burst-sensitive thread targeting (each cluster of customer messages got its own Slack thread), a routing bug emerged: if the operator's reply started a new Slack thread anchored on a later message, the customer's response to that thread came back with a `thread_ts` that didn't match the conversation's canonical key, and ingress would create a brand-new conversation for it. The inbox looked like the thread history had been lost. Fixed by reverting to conversation-anchored thread targeting: every operator reply now targets the conversation's root `thread_ts` (the first customer message), so every customer response lands back in the same conversation. Explicit "reply to this specific message" from the UI still overrides.

## [0.1.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- **Slack ingress filter now distinguishes our own bot from other bots.** Previously we dropped every bot-authored Slack message at the ingress boundary to stop `chat.postMessage` echoes from leaking into the inbox. That was correct for echoes but over-aggressive: it also silently threw away messages from other integrations posting in the same channel (e.g. a GitHub app uploading a PR diff). The filter now compares each event's `user` field against `installation.botUserId` (captured at OAuth install time) and drops only our own bot. Other-integration bot messages pass through and will be mirrored once file-attachment support lands. Legacy installs where `botUserId` is null fall back to the old blanket drop — safe default until they re-install or backfill the field.
- **Dev seed honors `SLACK_DEV_BOT_USER_ID` env var.** If you're dev-testing against a real Slack workspace, set `SLACK_DEV_BOT_USER_ID` in `.env` to your workspace's actual bot user ID so the echo filter works out of the box. Without the env var, the seed uses a placeholder that only works for synthetic (no-real-Slack) dev loops.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Session replay recordings now actually land in the database.** Every browser session flushed by the TrustLoop SDK was silently failing to write because Prisma's `upsert()` cannot target a partial unique index. Replaced with a manual find-or-create inside the existing transaction. Session replay history picks up the moment the fix deploys.
- **Operator replies no longer show up as duplicate customer messages.** Slack's Events API echoes every `chat.postMessage` call back as a new message event, and the old ingress pipeline was ingesting those echoes as customer bubbles in the inbox, making it look like the customer was saying the same thing as the operator. The ingress now drops bot-authored and system-noise events (edits, pins, channel joins) at the boundary.
- **Replies now land in the most relevant Slack thread.** When a customer sends several messages in a row, the operator's reply targets whichever message is newest at send time, then every follow-up reply in that same burst stays in the same thread. Previous behavior threaded everything off the first-ever message in the conversation, which pushed operator answers out of the visual conversation flow. Explicit "reply to this message" from the inbox UI still overrides.

### Changed
- **Queue worker dev script now uses `tsx watch`.** Editing activities or workflow code under `apps/queue/src` triggers an automatic worker restart, eliminating a whole class of "why isn't my fix taking effect" bugs.
- **Naming convention for Temporal workflow/activity files.** Every artifact for a feature now shares one hyphenated prefix (`support-analysis.workflow.ts`, `support-analysis.activity.ts`, `support-analysis.schema.ts`, `support-analysis-service.ts`) so a single fuzzy search surfaces all of it. Renamed the support-analysis workflow + trigger files to match. Documented in `AGENTS.md` as a non-negotiable naming rule.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Google sign-in.** New users can click "Continue with Google" on `/login` and land in TrustLoop without ever creating a password. Google is now the primary sign-in CTA; email/password is available behind a disclosure link. No existing users are affected.
- **Workspace auto-join by verified email domain.** When a user signs in with Google at a domain that already has a TrustLoop workspace (e.g. `@acme.com` → the Acme workspace), they join it automatically as a MEMBER. No admin invite required. Email must be Google-verified as a defense-in-depth check against domain spoofing. Personal email domains (gmail, outlook, etc.) are explicitly blocked from matching.
- **Warm `/no-workspace` experience for new customers.** First-time users from a domain without a TrustLoop workspace land on a friendly "Your team hasn't set up TrustLoop yet — email hello@trustloop.com" page. The TrustLoop team provisions workspaces manually during customer onboarding.
- **Funnel-level audit events.** `auth.google.first_sign_in` fires on first-ever Google sign-in with the user's email domain and whether it matched a workspace. `auth.google.auto_joined` fires when auto-join actually happens. Every callback also emits a structured log line with the outcome (`new_user_auto_joined` / `new_user_no_workspace` / `returning_user`) for future support questions.
- `AuthIdentity` model linking `(provider, providerAccountId)` to `User`, with schema hooks for GitHub, Microsoft, and SAML providers later at ~30 minutes each.
- `Workspace.emailDomain` column with partial unique index for auto-join lookups.
- `User.name` and `User.avatarUrl` nullable columns, populated from the Google profile on first sign-in.

### Changed
- `User.passwordHash` is now nullable. Google-only users have no password.
- Password login in `auth-router.ts` now rejects null-hash users with the same generic 401 as a wrong-password attempt. No information leaks about which accounts exist or which provider they're linked to.
- `UserIdentity` TS type in `user-service.ts` renamed to `UserIdentityRecord` to free the name for the new Prisma model.

### Infrastructure
- `jose@6.2.2` added to `@shared/rest` for Google id_token verification with JWKS caching and rotation.
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_PATH` env vars added to the shared schema (all optional — Google sign-in is hidden when unset).
- New routes `/api/auth/google/start` and `/api/auth/google/callback`.
- New `auth.providers` publicProcedure on the tRPC auth router for CLI/test clients.

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Soft delete support for all Tier 1 models (User, Workspace, WorkspaceMembership, WorkspaceApiKey, SupportInstallation, SupportConversation, SupportDeliveryAttempt, SupportTicketLink)
- Prisma Client extension that auto-filters soft-deleted records from all read queries
- Partial unique indexes so disconnecting and reconnecting Slack (or removing and re-adding members) no longer hits unique constraint errors
- Cascade soft delete services for workspace, installation, and conversation hierarchies
- Typed `resurrectOrUpsert()` helper that handles the check-deleted / resurrect / or-create pattern
- `cascadeDeactivateUser()` function that soft-deletes a user and hard-deletes their sessions
- Purge function for permanently removing records past 90-day retention
- Spec document covering model classification, schema changes, and edge cases

### Changed
- Slack disconnect now soft-deletes the installation and cascades to conversations
- Workspace member removal now soft-deletes instead of hard-deleting
- Conversation upsert now checks for and resurrects soft-deleted records with the same canonical key
- Session resolution now blocks soft-deleted users at request time
- FK cascade rules changed from CASCADE to RESTRICT on soft-deletable parent models
