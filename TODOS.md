# TODOS

## Auth & Onboarding

### Self-serve workspace creation UI

**What:** Let the first user at a brand-new domain create a workspace themselves (becoming OWNER), instead of landing at `/no-workspace` and waiting for the TrustLoop team to provision it manually.

**Why:** Launching Google sign-in with white-glove provisioning (TrustLoop team sets `Workspace.emailDomain` by hand) is the right move for pilot #1-#5 — it forces a human first contact with every prospect, prevents domain squatting, and removes a whole UI from launch scope. But once you're doing 5+ pilots a week, manual provisioning becomes the bottleneck.

**Context:** Added from `/plan-ceo-review` of the Google sign-in plan on 2026-04-11. The CEO review selected SELECTIVE EXPANSION and accepted workspace auto-join by verified email domain for users whose domain already matches a workspace. For new domains, the user chose "land at /no-workspace with a 'Contact us' message" instead of auto-creating a workspace. That decision is smart now but should be revisited when the manual workflow becomes a bottleneck.

When you pick this up: the `AuthIdentity` model, `Workspace.emailDomain` column, and `resolveWorkspaceFromVerifiedEmail` helper already exist. You'll need: (1) a new workspace-create form on `/no-workspace` prefilled with the domain and a proposed name, (2) a confirmation step that sets `Workspace.emailDomain`, (3) protection against domain squatting (maybe: domain must pass a DNS TXT verification, or only allow if the user's `email_verified=true` AND the domain isn't on the personal-email block list, which it already is).

**Effort:** M (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Initial Google sign-in + auto-join PR landing (in flight on main).

### `hd` (hosted domain) parameter per-workspace for customer-restricted sign-in

**What:** Let a workspace admin restrict Google sign-in for their workspace to only users from a specific Google Workspace `hd` domain. Pass the `hd` parameter on `/authorize` and verify it on the returned id_token.

**Why:** Enterprise-lite SSO. A customer with strict identity policies can say "only @acme.com Google Workspace accounts can sign in to our TrustLoop workspace" without requiring full SAML/SCIM.

**Context:** Added from `/plan-ceo-review` of the Google sign-in plan on 2026-04-11. Deferred because there is no customer demand signal yet — no prospect has asked for it. The full SSO/SAML/SCIM path is still the post-P0 end state per `docs/domains/auth/spec-auth-workspace-security-p0.md`. This is a half-measure that provides enterprise comfort without committing to the full SSO build.

When you pick this up: add a `hostedDomain String?` field to `Workspace`, pass it as `hd` on the Google authorization URL, verify the `hd` claim on the returned id_token matches. Reject with a clear error if not. Should take ~1 hour of CC time.

**Effort:** S (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Google sign-in + auto-join PR landing. Customer asking for it.

### Multiple email domains per workspace (`WorkspaceEmailDomain` table)

**What:** Support multiple email domains matching the same workspace — e.g. Acme Corp with subsidiaries `acme.com`, `acme-eu.com`, and a recent acquisition `bravo.io`, all of which should auto-join the Acme workspace.

**Why:** Real companies have acquisitions, regional subsidiaries, and brand multiples. A single `emailDomain` column covers pilot #1-#10 but will break the first time a real enterprise signs up.

**Context:** Added from `/plan-ceo-review` of the Google sign-in plan on 2026-04-11. The initial design uses a simple `Workspace.emailDomain String?` column with a partial unique index. This is the right call for speed now. When the first customer with multiple domains hits, promote to a many-to-one `WorkspaceEmailDomain` table with a backfill: `INSERT INTO workspace_email_domain (workspaceId, domain) SELECT id, emailDomain FROM workspace WHERE emailDomain IS NOT NULL`.

**Effort:** S (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** First customer with multiple domains asking.

### Personal-email block list for paid plan seats

**What:** Prevent personal-email domain users (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.) from occupying paid plan seats on a customer's workspace.

**Why:** When billing ships, you don't want a customer paying for seats that are "alice.random@gmail.com" — it's an accidental freeloader problem and a licensing concern.

**Context:** Added from `/plan-ceo-review` of the Google sign-in plan on 2026-04-11. The `PERSONAL_EMAIL_DOMAINS` reject list already exists in `workspace-auto-join-service.ts` — it blocks personal emails from being used as workspace match keys during auto-join. This TODO extends that list to be enforced at seat assignment time once billing exists.

**Effort:** S (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Billing/metering work shipping (Deliverable D in the MVP plan).

## Code Indexing

### Unified Escalation Timeline Panel

**What:** Build a single timeline that stitches Slack messages, Sentry events, Linear updates, Git activity, and index freshness into one chronological view.

**Why:** On-call engineers currently context-switch across tools; this deferred expansion unlocks faster root-cause analysis and safer PR intent decisions.

**Context:** Deferred from `/plan-ceo-review` for GitHub indexing so v1 can focus on core repo connect, indexing, hybrid retrieval, explainability, freshness guardrails, PR intent contract, and relevance feedback. Start by defining a normalized event schema and read model for workspace-scoped escalations.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Shipping the v1 indexing/search foundation and event ingestion contracts (Slack/Sentry/Linear/GitHub)

### No-Flag Rollout Runbook + Rollback Drill

**What:** Define and validate an explicit no-feature-flag rollout and rollback runbook for indexing/search deployments.

**Why:** The plan intentionally skips feature flags, so deployment safety depends on strict migration/deploy/smoke-check sequencing and rehearsed rollback steps.

**Context:** Added from `/plan-eng-review` after choosing no flags in architecture decisions. Include: migration-first order, worker dark-run checks, read-only search smoke script, rollback trigger thresholds, and owner/on-call responsibilities.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Initial indexing/search implementation branch reaching deployable state

## Slack Ingestion

### Tighten bot-message filter to installation.botUserId

**What:** Replace the blanket `authorRoleBucket === bot` drop in `apps/queue/src/domains/support/support.activity.ts:118` with a targeted filter that only drops messages from our specific installation's bot user ID. Preserve bot-authored messages from other integrations (e.g., GitHub app posting a PR screenshot).

**Why:** The slack-functionality design doc §3 ("Inbound file flow — actor handling") explicitly says files from `bot_id`-authored messages from other integrations should still be mirrored and rendered under a bot avatar. The session's quick fix dropped ALL bot messages to stop our own chat.postMessage echoes from double-ingesting. That's over-aggressive but harmless today because no file mirroring exists yet. When Pillar A lands, other-bot files will silently disappear unless this is fixed first.

**Context:** Landed from `/plan-eng-review` on 2026-04-11 as a known conflict with the Slack functionality design doc. The blanket filter is in place because: (a) the Slack Events API echoes every `chat.postMessage` call back as a message event, (b) we had no way to distinguish our echoes from other bots without an installation.botUserId lookup, and (c) the debugging cost was immediate while the design conflict was not. The design doc expects the `users.info`-resolved bot user ID to be stored on `SupportInstallation.metadata` at OAuth install time. That plumbing doesn't exist yet — adding it is the first step of this TODO.

When you pick this up: (1) capture `authed_user.id` or `bot_user_id` from the Slack OAuth v2 response in `slack-oauth-service.ts` and persist to `SupportInstallation.metadata.botUserId`, (2) pass the bot user ID through to the ingress activity via the existing `installation` eager-load, (3) in `runSupportPipeline`, change the drop condition from `DROPPED_AUTHOR_ROLES.has(role)` to `(role === bot && slackUserId === installation.metadata.botUserId) || role === system`, (4) backfill `botUserId` for existing installations via a one-shot migration or lazy-resolve on first inbound event. Add a test case for "other bot with files is NOT dropped" in `slack-event-normalizer.test.ts` (or the activity's integration test, once that exists).

**Effort:** S (human: ~4 hours / CC: ~45 min)
**Priority:** P1 — blocks Pillar A (file mirroring) from working correctly for bot-authored file uploads.
**Depends on:** No hard blockers. Can be done any time before Pillar A ships.

### Session-ingest upsert race retry

**What:** `apps/web/src/server/http/rest/sessions/ingest.ts:120-156` replaced Prisma's `upsert()` with a manual `findFirst → update | create` because `upsert()` can't target the partial unique index on `(workspaceId, sessionId) WHERE deletedAt IS NULL`. The manual version introduces a race: two concurrent flushes for the same sessionId can both see "not found" and both try to create, leading to a unique-constraint violation on the second one.

**Why:** Currently caught in the `console.error` path at line 191 and logged as `[session-ingest] Async write failed`. The SDK will retry on next flush (10s later) so session data converges eventually. This is acceptable for now — the worst case is a 10-second delay on new session creation under extreme concurrency. But in production under load, this will fill the logs with unique-violation errors.

**Context:** Landed from `/plan-eng-review` on 2026-04-11. The original Prisma `upsert()` was broken (ON CONFLICT doesn't target partial unique indexes — see CLAUDE.md → Soft Delete Rules). The replacement is correct for the soft-delete case but loses Prisma's atomic upsert semantics.

When you pick this up: wrap the `tx.sessionRecord.create(...)` in a try/catch on `Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError` with code `P2002`, and on that specific error, retry the entire transaction from the `findFirst`. Two attempts max. Alternative: use a Postgres advisory lock keyed on `(workspaceId, sessionId)` to serialize concurrent creates. The retry approach is simpler and matches the rest of the codebase's conflict handling.

**Effort:** S (human: ~1 hour / CC: ~10 min)
**Priority:** P2 — not blocking, but will surface as log noise under production load.
**Depends on:** None.

### Projection Replay and Backfill Tooling

**What:** Build scoped replay tooling to rebuild conversation projections from immutable event logs with dry-run support.

**Why:** Prevent manual database intervention when projection drift or schema evolution issues appear in production.

**Context:** The approved Slack ingestion/event-sourced design includes projection health visibility, but replay operations are not fully specified for operators.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Event schema/versioning finalized and projection table shape stabilized.

### Slack Connect Diagnostics and Repair Console

**What:** Add diagnostics tooling to inspect Slack team/channel identity mappings and support controlled remap/repair actions.

**Why:** Reduce time-to-recovery for cross-org Slack Connect identity edge cases that can break deterministic grouping.

**Context:** The plan adopts canonical team-aware conversation identity, but does not yet include dedicated operational diagnostics.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Base installation mapping tables/events and operator permission model.

### Synthetic Load and Chaos Harness for Ingestion Pipeline

**What:** Create a test harness for duplicate event storms, Slack rate-limit bursts, and projection lag spikes.

**Why:** Validate retry/idempotency behavior under realistic failure pressure before broader rollout.

**Context:** The engineering review mandates complete unit/integration/E2E coverage, but stress and chaos behavior needs a dedicated harness.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Core ingest/group/projection/retry pipeline implemented.

### Handoff Brief Panel (Post-Summary Phase)

**What:** Add a conversation handoff brief panel that summarizes open asks, latest owner action, latest customer message, and suggested next step.

**Why:** Reduce on-call context-switch cost when threads change hands and prevent missed follow-up after ownership changes.

**Context:** Explicitly deferred in CEO selective expansion to avoid low-signal summaries before chat summarization and code indexing are production-stable.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Summary pipeline + code index context availability.

### Linear Integration After Context Quality Gate

**What:** Integrate conversation records with Linear tickets (link, status sync, blocked/stuck signal propagation) once context quality gates pass.

**Why:** Improve triage accuracy and stale detection by tying thread state to real ticket lifecycle without forcing premature integration complexity.

**Context:** CEO review accepted phased ticket-status plumbing now, but deferred direct Linear integration until summary and code-index context are reliable.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Summary pipeline + code index context + stable ticket-link schema.

### Canonical Replay Fixture Pack for Slack Ingestion

**What:** Create a reusable fixture pack for ingestion and grouping tests (duplicate storms, out-of-order events, attachment-only events, Slack Connect identity edges, retry envelopes).

**Why:** Make regressions deterministic and reduce debugging time when idempotency/grouping behavior changes.

**Context:** Added during eng delta review to support Wave-1/Wave-2 quality gates and avoid ad-hoc fixture drift across test suites.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Core normalized event schema and canonical idempotency key format locked.

### On-Call Runbook Pack for Ingestion Controls

**What:** Publish operator runbooks for Slack ingress pause/resume procedures, dead-letter triage, replay execution, and customer-notification recovery checklist.

**Why:** Ensure incidents can be handled quickly and consistently under pressure, including after-hours support.

**Context:** Accepted in eng delta review as low-cost reliability leverage after choosing CI-first rollout with minimal emergency controls.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Operational pause/resume controls + dead-letter/replay command surface implemented.

## Design System

### Create Canonical DESIGN.md for TrustLoop

**What:** Run design-system definition and publish a repo-wide `DESIGN.md` that supersedes per-feature local token appendices.

**Why:** Prevent UI drift and repeated design debates as new inbox/settings surfaces are added.

**Context:** The Slack ingestion plan currently carries local design tokens because `DESIGN.md` does not exist yet.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None.

### Mobile Inbox Ergonomics Audit

**What:** Execute a focused mobile usability pass for inbox detail flow (pinned composer + action drawer + keyboard overlap behavior).

**Why:** Reduce reply friction and accidental actions in high-pressure operator workflows on smaller screens.

**Context:** The plan specifies mobile behavior, but ergonomic validation is deferred until UI implementation exists.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Initial inbox mobile UI implementation.

### Accessibility Validation Suite for Inbox Surfaces

**What:** Add dedicated a11y validation coverage for queue/timeline/action surfaces (keyboard-only journey, live-region announcements, status contrast checks).

**Why:** Ensure accessibility requirements become verifiable done criteria rather than undocumented intent.

**Context:** The design review added explicit accessibility requirements, but test coverage for these checks is not yet planned as a separate work item.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Core inbox UI and interaction states implemented.

## Soft Delete

### Purge Job Scheduling

**What:** Wire `purgeDeletedRecords()` to a Temporal scheduled workflow or cron task.

**Why:** Without scheduling, soft-deleted records accumulate forever. The purge function exists but has no caller.

**Context:** Function exists at `packages/database/src/purge.ts` with 90-day retention and dependency-ordered deletion using `prismaRaw` (non-extended client). Needs a Temporal workflow that calls it on a daily/weekly schedule. The purge deletes in child-first order to respect `onDelete: Restrict` constraints.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Soft delete implementation landed.

### Document Partial Unique Index / Prisma Schema Divergence

**What:** Add comprehensive documentation explaining that `@@unique` in `schema.prisma` drives TypeScript type generation only, while actual DB constraints are partial unique indexes managed in raw SQL migrations.

**Why:** Prevents accidental full unique index recreation on next `prisma migrate dev`. Prisma 7 schema DSL doesn't support partial indexes. Future schema changes on soft-deletable models must write raw SQL migrations for unique constraint changes.

**Context:** Schema comments have been added to each affected model. CLAUDE.md has a soft delete rules section. This TODO covers creating a dedicated `docs/soft-delete-guide.md` with full operational procedures for adding new soft-deletable models, modifying unique constraints, and running introspection safely.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** Soft delete migration landed.
