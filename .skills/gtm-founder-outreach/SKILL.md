  Founder outreach workflow for TrustLoop's early GTM motion. Use when the task
  is to find target companies, find the right founder or co-founder, qualify
  whether they fit the current ICP, score leads, draft contact-specific
  outreach DMs, or update the outreach tracker. Good triggers include:
  "who should I DM", "find founders", "find co-founders", "find companies",
  "qualify leads", "score this lead", "what should I send",
  "help with outreach", or "source founder prospects".
  Use this instead of ad-hoc outreach advice so sourcing, scoring, and messaging
  stay grounded in the repo's current GTM thesis.

# GTM Founder Outreach

This skill turns the repo's GTM docs into a repeatable sourcing and outreach
loop.

## Canonical Context

Read these files first:

- `business/gtm/icp-and-positioning.md`
- `business/gtm/sourcing-playbook.md`
- `business/gtm/lead-scoring-rubric.md`
- `business/gtm/outreach-copy.md`
- `business/gtm/STATUS.md`

Read these when relevant:

- `business/gtm/call-notes-template.md` for discovery calls
- `business/gtm/learnings.md` when updating patterns after replies or calls

## Purpose

Use this skill to help with four jobs:

1. find candidate companies
2. find the founder or co-founder to contact
3. score whether the lead is worth messaging
4. draft a short, contact-specific DM

The current wedge is narrow on purpose. Do not broaden it unless the repo docs
have been updated.

## Workflow

### 1. Re-ground in the ICP

Before sourcing or writing copy, restate the current target in one sentence.

If the request would push beyond the current wedge, say so and keep the output
anchored to the documented ICP unless the user explicitly wants to change it.

### 2. Source Companies

Prefer the cheapest-good stack documented in `business/gtm/sourcing-playbook.md`:

- YC Companies
- LinkedIn
- the outreach sheet / tracker

When sourcing companies:

- prefer B2B SaaS, workflow-heavy, integration-heavy, ops software, devtools
- avoid consumer apps, agencies, generic marketplaces, and obviously too-large teams
- only keep companies where you can form a pain hypothesis about founder-led support

### 3. Find and Qualify the Contact

For each company, look for:

- Founder
- Co-Founder
- Co-Founder & CEO
- Founder & CEO
- CEO

Before accepting a lead, write one sentence answering:

`Why does this founder or co-founder plausibly feel the support-routing pain?`

If that sentence is weak, the lead is weak.

### 4. Score the Lead

Use `business/gtm/lead-scoring-rubric.md`.

Default output per lead:

- company
- contact
- role
- one-line pain hypothesis
- score out of `10`
- short reason for the score

Default recommendation:

- `8-10` message now
- `5-7` keep as backup
- `0-4` skip

### 5. Draft the DM

Use `business/gtm/outreach-copy.md` as the base voice.

Rules:

- keep it short
- lead with the pain, not the product
- do not ask for a demo
- personalize the first line when possible
- optimize for a reply, not a conversion

When drafting outreach, output:

- the DM
- one sentence explaining why it fits this founder or co-founder

### 6. Update the Tracker or Prepare Rows

If the user provides a tracker destination, update it directly.

If not, return rows that can be pasted into the tracker with these fields:

- Contact Name
- Contact Role
- LinkedIn URL
- Company
- Company URL
- YC Batch
- Estimated Team Size
- Category
- Why They Match
- Pain Guess
- Fit Score

### 7. Capture Learnings

After real replies or calls, summarize the signal into `business/gtm/learnings.md`
or propose the exact update.

Prioritize:

- repeated language
- repeated pain
- objections
- wedge changes

## Guardrails

- Do not target multiple ICPs at once.
- Do not call a founder or co-founder a good lead without a concrete pain hypothesis.
- Do not write long generic outreach.
- Do not confuse curiosity with painful demand.
- Ten sharp leads beat one hundred vague ones.

## Default Deliverables

For sourcing tasks, return the best concise artifact for the user's request:

- `Top leads`: table of `5-10` qualified founders or co-founders with scores and pain hypotheses
- `Lead review`: scored keep/skip recommendation
- `Outreach draft`: `1-3` DMs and optional follow-up
- `Tracker update`: rows written or ready to paste

## Completion Checklist

- ICP was used explicitly
- every lead has a one-line reason
- every lead has a score
- every DM is short and specific
- tracker rows or structured output are ready to use
